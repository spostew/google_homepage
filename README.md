This is my first offical introduction into building a website. Starting from nothing and working towards a better future for myself. Learning the code has been difficult because of the minimal time i've put into it so far but i'm starting to get the hang of it now. I can create basic commands and understand a fair amount of HTTPS although practice makes perfect.
